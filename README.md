## GitHub Repositories  
I have been learning python, here are some simple python repositries as a show case of my learning journey.   

| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| [**Student Performance Analyzer**](https://github.com/Maryam7711/Student-performance-analyzer.git) | Stores student records, calculates averages, and identifies top performers. Also provides department-wise toppers and performance classification. |
| [**Student Transcript Generator**](https://github.com/Maryam7711/Student-transcript-generator.git) | Generates transcripts by taking inputs, validating marks, and calculating totals and grades with formatted output. |
| [**Memory Calculator**](https://github.com/Maryam7711/Memory-Calculator.git) | A smart calculator that remembers the last result, supports memory recall, and handles invalid inputs gracefully. |
